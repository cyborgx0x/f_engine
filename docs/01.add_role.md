## Add new Role

Recently I though that I need to separate the trading flow to several processes.

This will benefit me in the long run. 
Currently analyzing which part cause the problem is not easy due to the cross over of each part. 

New Role will also change the way I develop this project as I will shift from action oriented tor entity orirented

## what is the different

1. The program layout will be changed. The previous is focus in action, which I define in the function. The later is focus in entity, which I will define in class.
2. Each trading process take many many steps, and a lot of effort to create the best ideas. Write the whole thing from the bottom up is not very efficient in the long run. Many tools will involve in each process and each entity will need to decide what kind of tools is the best for each circumstance. 

## How I will change this program

I did not use this program regularly, and that is the problem. Not only my program is hard to use, but it also does not give any helpful insight to my trading decision.
It also lacks the abilities to backtest other trading platform,
