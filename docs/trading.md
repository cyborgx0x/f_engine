Mean Reversion:

Example: A trader notices that a particular stock has experienced a sharp decline in price, which they believe is an overreaction. Based on historical data and analysis, they determine that the stock's price tends to revert to its mean within a certain timeframe. The trader takes a long position in the stock, anticipating that its price will bounce back to its average level, generating a profit.

Statistical Arbitrage:

Example: A trader identifies two stocks in the same industry that historically move together. However, they notice that one of the stocks has recently experienced a significant price increase, while the other stock's price has remained relatively unchanged. Based on the historical relationship between the two stocks, the trader takes a short position in the stock that has risen and a long position in the stock that has lagged behind, expecting the price disparity to converge, resulting in a profit.

Momentum:

Example: A trader observes that a particular cryptocurrency has been consistently exhibiting strong upward price momentum. They decide to enter a long position in the cryptocurrency, anticipating that the positive trend will continue and generate further price gains. The trader may employ technical indicators or other momentum-based signals to validate and time their entry and exit points.

Pairs Trading:

Example: A trader identifies two highly correlated stocks in the technology sector. They notice that one of the stocks has experienced a temporary price decline, while the other stock has remained relatively stable. The trader decides to take a long position in the stock that has fallen and a short position in the stock that has remained stable, expecting the prices to converge again based on their historical relationship. The strategy aims to profit from the price spread between the two stocks.

Event-driven Strategies:

Example: A trader closely monitors the earnings announcement season for a specific sector. They identify a pattern where companies with better-than-expected earnings tend to experience significant price increases. The trader takes long positions in the stocks of companies that are anticipated to report positive earnings surprises, aiming to capture the price appreciation resulting from the positive news.

Machine Learning and AI-based Strategies:

Example: A trader develops a machine learning model that analyzes vast amounts of financial data, such as historical price patterns, fundamental indicators, news sentiment, and social media trends. The model learns patterns and relationships from the data to generate trading signals. Based on the model's output, the trader enters and exits positions in various assets, relying on the model's ability to identify potential market opportunities and generate profits.
